Yun Liang’s scroll cell phone drew inspiration from how traditional Chinese paintings are unfurled. It may be wildly untraditional given our current cell phone market (as in, it must be sleek and chic and have a touchscreen), but it offers a user experience far more unique and tactile than other concepts like the Rainbow gem phone. 
When you're not using it, the phone rolls into a neat little tube. All numeric key functions run along the side of the screen, which means it doesn't necessarily have to be unrolled to work. For an additional image,  read more

By now you probably know I'm totally addicted to my beautiful BlackBerry Pearl and my fabulous iPod. While they still hold the top spot of my favorite list, I am sure this will change when the iPhone arrives later this week! But what I want to know is, what are your favorite gadgets?

Before I owned a digital camera I would take my 35mm film camera everywhere I went. One concern I always had was whether or not my film would be ruined going through airport security checkpoints. With traditional film cameras, there's a higher risk that film will be damaged by the X-Ray machines during security screening, even though this hasn't happened to me. Just to be on the safe side, have your camera checked separately by hand or ask the security staff if the X-Ray machines are safe for film - usually the posters in the area will indicate whether or not you need to remove film. As for digital cameras, your pictures should be completely safe.
